# Build-time config for the Port Buddy web app (consumed by Vite)
# Copy this file to .env, .env.development, or .env.production and adjust values.

# Base URL for API requests from the SPA. Leave empty to use same-origin.
# Example: https://portbuddy.dev
VITE_API_BASE=

# Canonical URL of the site (used in <link rel="canonical">)
# Example: https://portbuddy.dev/
VITE_CANONICAL=

# Open Graph URL (used in <meta property="og:url">)
# Example: https://portbuddy.dev/
VITE_OG_URL=

# Notes:
# - In development, if VITE_API_BASE is empty and you run Vite on localhost:5173,
#   the app will call the backend at http://localhost:8080 automatically.
# - If you want canonical and og:url to be the same, set both to the same value here.
